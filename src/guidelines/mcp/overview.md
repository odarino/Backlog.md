## Backlog.md Overview (MCP)

Backlog.md tracks committed work: what will be built, fixed, or changed.

### When to Use Backlog

Create a task when work requires planning, decisions, or handoff notes. Skip task creation for questions, exploration, and obvious mechanical edits.

Search first with `task_search` or `task_list`, then read matching work with `task_view`. Use the existing task, or follow the creation guide if none fits. Tasks must include enough context for someone without the current conversation to start work.

### Required Guides

Read the matching resource before taking these actions; this overview does not replace it:

- `backlog://workflow/task-creation` — before creating or splitting tasks
- `backlog://workflow/task-execution` — before planning, changing status or assignee, adding notes, or implementing
- `backlog://workflow/task-finalization` — before checking acceptance criteria, writing final summaries, or marking work finished

### Task Lifecycle

Mark finished work Done (or the configured final status). Leave it on the board until periodic cleanup with `task_complete`. Use `task_archive` only for canceled, duplicate, or invalid work.

### MCP Tools Quick Reference

- `task_list` — list tasks with optional filtering by status, configured task type, configured project, assignee (or `unassigned: true`), milestone, labels, search, `ready: true` for unblocked tasks, or limit
- `task_search` — search tasks by title and description, or filter by configured task type, configured project, and project-root-relative `modifiedFiles` path substrings
- `task_view` — read full task context (description, plan, notes, comments, final summary, acceptance criteria, Definition of Done)
- `definition_of_done_defaults_get` — read project-level Definition of Done defaults from config
- `definition_of_done_defaults_upsert` — replace project-level Definition of Done defaults in config
- `document_list` — list documents, including type, path, timestamps, and tags
- `document_view` — view document metadata and markdown content
- `document_create` — create a document with title, content, optional type/tags, and optional docs-directory-relative path
- `document_update` — update document content, optional title/type/tags, and optional docs-directory-relative path
- `document_search` — search documents using the shared fuzzy index
- `task_create` — create new tasks with description and acceptance criteria; DoD fields are for **exceptional** task-level overrides only (`definitionOfDoneAdd`, `disableDefinitionOfDoneDefaults`)
- `task_clone` — copy a task into a new task (content, labels, links and checklists, unchecked); resets the status (drafts stay drafts), due date, notes, summary, and comments
- `task_edit` — update task metadata, status, plan, notes, comments (`commentsAppend` with optional `commentAuthor`), final summary, acceptance criteria, task-level Definition of Done (`definitionOfDoneAdd/Remove/Check/Uncheck`) for **exceptional** per-task updates, and dependencies
- DoD is not acceptance criteria: acceptance criteria define scope/behavior, while DoD tracks completion hygiene
- Comments are for discussion and review notes; Implementation Notes are for execution progress; Final Summary is the PR-style completion summary. Comment bodies may contain Markdown, but standalone `---` lines are reserved as comment delimiters.
- `task_complete` — move finished work off the board to completed storage during periodic cleanup; preserves its record and dependency links
- `task_archive` — archive canceled, duplicate, or invalid work; removes incoming dependencies and task references. Archived task IDs can be reused.

**Document path rules:** document paths are relative to the docs directory. Use `path` values like `guides/setup`; absolute paths and `..` traversal are rejected.

**Always operate through MCP tools. Never edit markdown files directly so relationships, metadata, and history stay consistent.**
